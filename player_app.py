    ### How the Tournament Works
    
    #### üéØ Scoring System
    - Win a match: 2 base points + up to 1 bonus point based on score difference
    - Lose a match: 1 base point + bonus points based on how close the game was
    - Example: In a 9-11 game
      - Winners get 2.2 points (2 base + 0.2 bonus)
      - Losers get 1.82 points (1 base + 0.82 performance bonus)
    
    #### ü§ù Player Matching
    Our smart matching system ensures:
    - Equal play time: Players with fewer games get priority
    - New partnerships: You'll play with different partners each round
    - Fresh competition: You'll face different opponents each time
    - No one sits out too long: Everyone plays a similar number of games
    
    #### üí´ Why This System?
    - Everyone earns points in every game - keeping it fun and engaging!
    - Close games are rewarded - keeping matches competitive
    - Good players shine even in losses - reflecting true skill levels
    - Mixed partnerships help you meet and play with everyone
    - Perfect for a social tournament where fun and fairness come first!
